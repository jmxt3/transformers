# Exploring Transformers with Hugging Face

This repository is dedicated to exploring the capabilities of the Hugging Face `transformers` library. It provides a collection of examples and resources to help you get started with using, fine-tuning, and deploying transformer models for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformers-exploration.git
cd transformers-exploration
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💡 Usage

This section will contain examples of how to use the pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub for tasks such as:

*   Text classification
*   Named entity recognition (NER)
*   Question answering
*   Summarization
*   Translation

## 🔧 Fine-Tuning

Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained model on your own dataset for a specific task. This section will cover:

*   Preparing your dataset
*   Setting up the training pipeline
*   Evaluating the fine-tuned model
